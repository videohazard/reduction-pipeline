wk08 presentation prep! 2024-03-26 

to discuss w/ eliot today: 
- project format 
- astrocodex as part of this research  

output is: 
1. obs proposal - what is planned 
	- break down steps to not lose structure 
2. poster - what i found 

in between - blog posts - what did i try 


### group meeting :) 

[meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y4uYi54qh6qtZ6JO5AAzrBxIdP5QmGHWXY9mH9LN4Yc/edit)

goals rn
- explore different packages/libraries/methods 
- get github repo set up 
- update 337 pipeline - get as far as figuring out what i can and can't keep; 



package both becca and nisa are using: wotan, for detrending lightcurves

one nice thing about github here is it is integrated with vscode, which streamlines the workflow wrt publilshing blog content etc, and will let me use Git to handle source control. this is probably not super necessary but I would like to get more comfortable with Git as I have only used it once or twice, cursory basic stuff. source control lives in the realm of mathematically pleasing concepts for me, but is not something i wound up getting to learn about w/ github as i wanted to for the 337 final project, because the structure of the group project was set up around google drive and changing it wasn't a huge priority. now, though, this is My Project and i do what i want! (also, we wound up using a new tool - typst.io, imagine gdocs but using a lite form of LaTeX, and generally better) because source control with three very busy people using gdocs and my workflow being mostly in obsidian (which integrates very nicely with github, and not so nicely with google suite) - well, source control was a fucking nightmare. for me at least. this feels like a good level of challenge for a first foray into it - and it will also be the first entry on my quasiprofessional github page that i can show to people. whatever resources/supplemental materials come out of this project, in addition to the goal of the fringing reduction .... oil pipeline... there's a shitty joke there somewhere, will be an open repository on github (+elsewhere? probably arxiv, cds? holy shit this is. my first published work yeah. maybe not a paper but)

not like, a paper, but im intending to  write noise reduction code specific to the telescope hardware at the PTO . using One Target as a test case to demonstrate step by step different statistical methods etc. everyone in this class already has written basically the same generic pipeline for reducing the basic kinds of noise you get with CCDs, and we're supposed to adapt that to our specific projects, but in my case im attempting to deal w/ a specific kind of noise that comes from circuitry and was NOT included in the generic noise reduction statistical method (CCD equation) but is included in some (cite). there's this oil slick effect basically and it's really pretty, like these weird contour lines, but it massively fucks photometry because it destroys your sampling accuracy(?) unless you get REALLY nitpicky with the apertures which is NOT realistic when youre using DAOPhot starfinder and n=1394. but the nice thing is it's inherent to the circuitry which means a lot of really in depth chasing electrons and the like can quantify it - a personal map for that circuit board, all its flaws laid out pixel by pixel. so its present in every single exposure which means i have the widest possible subset of our data pool AND whatever success i have is applicable to everyone else's projects too. which is fucking sick. also the PTO is  a pretty heavily trafficked telescope. so if this code is good a lot of  people are going to be using it.

THIS FUCKS 
i love astropy i need to learn as much about astropy as possible thank you. command line utility AUUGUGHH <3

https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/index_user_docs.html

timeseries looks directly relevant 


another resource found! https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/ sphinx, for making pretty documentation! will be using this in combination w/ obsidian to make my docs/blog preeeeetty

units are like the source code of physics. im starting to truly understand what all my professors have meant when they say you can derive anything from first principles - the units.

objective: organize my shit god  help 
this is the most effective use of structured work time that this class is, currently 

objective: *blog* - collect useful material to diffuse/edit into blog posts whee

distinct objective: *methods* 
- [ ] go thru lab 3 again w/ LHS 2206 
- [ ] run LHS 2206 through final 337 pipeline (ishan re-emailed it)
- [ ] outline desired directory structure that will be on github (ie how to organize the diff pipeline files etc)


things i did during this work session 
- practiced terminal to move files instead of manually (mv, cp)
![[Pasted image 20240402204617.png]]
pictured: me struggling to remember basic syntax 



NB: ACTUAL final pipeline file is in 337 directory and is called 337.py 

made my life easier by realizing that, as per example in lab 6, i can import this as a python module! this is nice because, unlike the data (several GB), the module is very portable 
one other nice thing about this setup is it actually makes it easier for me to do simple tasks (for example, a quick test run of a module/function) directly in terminal rather than by using os commands in a python notebook 
for blog purposes, either works, since i can just as easily paste my terminal output 

for right now, my workflow is 
- the file folder 
- a337.py 
open in VSCode 

leaving the script open in VSCode is ok for now since it's easy to read that way (Notepad++ would also be good, easier readability than the default text editor)

i will actually practice running the script in (the built in VSCode) terminal

only a few weeks left - 
current main goal: sketch out poster appearance, this functions as guidelines for trajectory to project outputs 

drafting process: walk around McConnell and sketch stuff i like in my sketchbook - this is mainly the formatting, but some content inspiration
