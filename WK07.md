week 7 (break!)
- rest & recover oh god 
- pipeline 337 i love you 
- read about ccd fringing thank you kim i love you kim 
- goal: collect all of my bibliography materials into a zotero folder.

i am writing this blog on 2024-03-24 (sunday) which doesn't bode well for the backlog But in my defense i write a lot anyways, compulsively, every day, so I do actually have backlogs, they're just going to be notes and such which have been retroactively edited into shape. Not cheating, now that I think about it - that's really just how lab notebooks work, with maybe a bit more leniency than is professionally recommended for an *actual* lab notebook, since (1) even I can't always read my own handwriting and (2) my shorthand warrants its own blog post with embedded figures, a tutorial, and possibly several infohazard warnings. What I mean by that is that much of my 'blogging' has just been me jotting down bits here and there intermittently, and now at the end of the week I collect them all into something Reflective and Demonstrative of Progress. In the future I would like to be more proactive about this - I haven't been as proactive as I'd like to be, which is a common writer's curse and also more of a general issue. Not necessarily in following a certain format with each week, but having something to show for it. My goal here is to question how much I have to show for the last few weeks' assignments (5, 6, 7) (need to refresh memory of former two and hunt down the pdf for the third - did eliot send it to me?) and (more or less complete, so not particularly a concern) labs (6, 7) (refresher will give me Material and help)


goal info:

- Probably have tabs on laptop + pc. 
- Haven't been using my pc much lately since it is functionally a gaming pc and the two monitors can sometimes be too overstimulating if not also distracting. Have Zotero already installed on PC, which makes scraping bibliography info from relevant tabs easy, but don't feel like trying to sync tabs btwn devices & possibly lose some. Very useful for reading and research, though - sometimes split screen isn't enough! 
- Need to install zotero on my laptop (there's probably a functional debian release) 
- other places to do cursory checks: a341 obsidian folder, a341 documents folder, legal pad/physical a341 notes, slack once i have access again 
	- TASK: regain access to slack (and by assn Moodle) by confirming my registration in a341 - this requires requesting credit overload with CNS academic dean. 
		- [ ] can search sent for message they sent me and bump it.
- This will bleed into filling out annotated bibliography, filling *in* comments on citations (in the observing proposal, notably, but for general use as well), categorizing the links I have (ie, saving a pdf copy of + generating citation for papers, saving html snapshot for general reference materials depending on formatting - in my experience Zotero is pretty good about automatically handling this, I just need to sort and tag my files properly)
	- tags?
	- part of this project output will be resources, so saving everything useful is paramount!
-> ==meeting 8 agenda - should discuss w/ Eliot abt the desired final output of this project ie The Tangible Form== to make sure we're on same page/have same starting bins for project map (could work on that again), and because pls let me do my weird media projects??
- can we meet on tuesday??? (in addn to thurs, since we missed last week) help

One other goal/general statement is that I intend to b...log (backlog) (backblog?) (sorry for committing linguistic crimes in my homework, it will happen again) the entire AST341 experience, including the observing run and probably a good deal of context related to AST337. This has many benefits: 
- I get to talk about it (cathartic) 
- I get blog material (homework)
- I get a little bit creative and unconventional with it (the format) (fun)
- I am engaged in creating something I'm having a lot of fun with, which in turn gives me the positive energy to get through the sloggy shit, *and* helps me maintain my trajectory/keep on task/continually reorient myself against true North
- I have something tangible I can share w/ people, and can continue to work on/share after this class is over 



things for actual project format/**deliverables** (my output, basically)
- narrative journey of a337, observing run, a341, uncanny comedy of errors and the Universe is out to get me, etc 
- walkthrough of my code 
- bootstrapping (?) time bay bee
