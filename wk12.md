20240115
- 001-020
- 274-293

observing log DOES NOT SPECIFY dome or sky for 001-020 but DOES for the rest

guess ill figure it out by inferring from what time it was (the logs are in UTC, MDT is 6 hours behind it so it wouldve been 6pm, astronomical twilight was at ??? on night 2/20240115)

here's a known V band dome flat, can visually compare the unknown flats to tell if sky or dome (probably won't need to look at I band dome flat/the differences between sky and dome flats should be roughly visible to the naked eye independent of filter)

001.....definitely the sky. these are probably our desperate attempt at getting twilight sky flats, iirc. 
actually this one might be a fucked up test image
thats definitely the sky but the flatness is debatable
nope not a test image
i do really love looking at these fucked up images
because ive put a lot of hours and a lot of struggling into understanding them and i can look at those pixels and interpret them

check images 001, 006, 011, 016 (beginning of each sequence)

001 - sky 
006 - sky 
011 - dome ??
016 - dome ??


manually sorted 

001-010 sky 
011-016 and 274-293 dome 
additional file 'test.fits' was a dome flat (i looked at it in ds9) so i threw it in the dome flats folder as well

looking good! (test.gif is from me playing around with ds9)

got another band-specific effect here, are(/how are) the rings on the I band one related to fringing?

okay infodump time. the little white marks in the top corners are noise from the amplifiers that read out the data. the concentric circles are probably dust on the telescope lens. the really big concentric circles in the top image are a band-specific effect and im not 100% whats up with that but it's probably fringing related. I WONDER if i could see the difference if i tried this on the 1/19 science images vs the 1/15 ones bc we had worse fringing one night than gthe other

ds9 trying to mess around w images 


the fringing gets highlighted with histogram equalization scale, but it (mostly) blends in against the bg w/ sinh scale

still on same image (021)

zscale linear- > zscale histogram 
noise minimal by amplifiers, interesting
smoothing out beforehand helps -- i assume this is a Gaussian blur function

![[Pasted image 20240430122220.png]]
smth in that UVT lecture notes on radio astronomy about *white* noise being a specific kind 

![[Pasted image 20240430122735.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240430122812.png]]

this brings out the overall effect of the noise really well actually, it's interesting that it's spreading from the bottom and avoids the amplifiers altogether

can see concentric rings visible in I-band flat
