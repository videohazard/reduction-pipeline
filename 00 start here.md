original goals from first one-on-one meeting, 2024-02-05

- **finish** the project 
- build a jumping-off point for potential future research
	- draft report of the final project 
	- instrumentation/hardware skills/building things 
	- be able to recommend next steps for detecting exoplanets w/ these data
	- organizing a project 
	- staying on track w/ reporting results/progress


As the project has progressed, naturally the associated goals have evolved, but the original goals still hold. My vague direction of instrumentation, etc. as an area I wanted to include in this project has wound up being the focus - actually, moreso than I anticipated. These goals were made independently of any target or specific topic in mind, although I was already interested in because of interesting possible activity during the [[observing run narrative log|observing run]]
